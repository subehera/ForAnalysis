STEP1:
Download the STARLight MC form this link "https://starlight.hepforge.org/" and generate the events as per your physics interest. You can change the PDGID for the 2-photon and vector meson channel.
Please note down the crossection value for the specific channel as your interest b/c it will require for the official production.
When you run the starlight MC you will get slight.out as as output data file. Use the macro to convert the starlight events to LHE events. 
STEP2:
There we need the driver command to work in cmssw interface
LHE  -> GS -> DIGI -> RECO , we need three cmsDriver command to reach the reco step.
Create the cmssw package you need and use the following driver command to get three different .py config file.
you need to store the LHE events in eos for the crab job submission.
You can use the crab config I attached in this git.
